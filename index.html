                  Question 1 Early in high school, I tinkered around with web development using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with Node.js on the server side. My brother and I started our high school’s web dev club and made the website for the school newspaper and microfinance club. Soon, I also delved into the world of app development, and had a lot of fun with swift as well. However, I really realized my passion for Computer Science when I started taking more rigorous CS classes, which taught me to appreciate how there are always many creative solutions to complex problems, and how some solutions are more elegant or efficient than others. I think this is aspect of programming is beautiful. In college, I started applying computer science to my scientific research. I worked in the Materials Simulation Center at Caltech, where I ran quantum mechanical calculations on platinum electrodes, and generalized the atomic interactions with a force field. Next year I plan to work in the Center for Autonomous Systems at Caltech and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I will be involved in machine learning and computer vision projects for spacecraft. Question2 Python. Last summer I did research at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, where I applied machine learning techniques to characterize nuclear abnormalities. I implemented dimension reduction algorithms and constructed a convolutional neural network classifier from scratch with tensorflow.I continued to tinker around and worked on several new projects. For example, I developed a stock tool program that predicts the future price of a stock based on historic trends and nonlinear function fitting. The program can also estimate how overbought or underbought the stock is, and use moving averages to identify when a stock starts to rise and when it peaks. To account for external market influence, I will create a text classifier to detect sentiment in news articles scraped from the google. To assemble the training set, i will scrape past news articles on specific stocks and assess the effect by analyzing normalized stock trends in the following days. Another ongoing project is a classifier that uses the tensorflow object detection api and the OpenCV library to identify armed, individuals from live surveillance video feeds. I am applying the same techniques in another ongoing project that converts a picture of handwriting, like notes or a lecture whiteboard, into text. Question 3 As a physics major at Caltech, I believe I have a unique perspective in programming. A large part of physics has to do with grasping the “bigger picture” and significance, trying to characterize the world qualitatively while also understanding it quantitatively. I believe that physics can give new insight into programming, as this combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis encourages “outside the box” thinking and the discovery of more “elegant” solutions to complex problems. On the other hand, I believe computational analysis can give new insight into physics as well. A book that really influenced me is “A New Kind of Science,” by Stephen Wolfram, founder of mathematica and former physics student and professor at Caltech. Wolfram basically describes a computational universe, in which physical structures and processes are modeled as elementary programs and automata. Question 4 I will be taking the machine learning track this year, as well as CS 38 (introduction to algorithms, and CS 24 (Computer systems). Question 5 I am a developer for the Caltech Donut, the university’s student website. I am also involved with the Caltech Mars Habitat Challenge team. I will be joining the Rocketry club this year, as well as the FSAE (electric vehicle competition) club.
