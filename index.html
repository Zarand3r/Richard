                  I am an ordinary guy who watched too much Star Trek as a kid. I would always dream about the future of technology and human civilization. Through luck and a bit of hard work, I have been granted the rare privilege of a world class education, and I am now ready to leverage the opportunities available to me and realize my childhood fantasies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I want to do my part in bringing the future...
                </p>
                <p>
                  I study physics and computer science at Caltech, and I am interested in quantum computing research, as I think it will revolutionize our civilization one day. I am currently completing a senior thesis with Professor Goddard in the Materials Simulation Center, where I perform quantum mechanical calculations and study semiconductors. I am very excited about the new AWS quantum computing center at Caltech, and hope to get involved in this intersection of physics and computer science.

                  I have been an avid programmer for most of my life. I taught myself fullstack development in highschool and completed the machine learning track at Caltech. I have several years of experience applying machine learning techniques and computer vision in both industry and scientific research. I am especially interested in neural programming, natural language processing, tensor algorithms, and reinforcement learning. I am currently working with Anima Anandkumar, director of ML research at NVIDIA, to try to apply semi-supervised learning techniques to complicated problems in the space of robotic surgery. I have also used my computational and analytical skills to help with ongoing research at Dana-Farber, LIGO, CAST, and NASA/JPL.

                  Recently, I have ventured into the world of finance, completing my internship as an investment associate at Bridgewater, the largest hedge fund in the world.

                  However, my life’s passion has always been space exploration, and I hope to some day contribute to advancing humanity toward a future of sailing across the stars. Space is truly the final frontier. I believe that asteroid mining is the next crucial stepping stone in humanity’s interstellar destiny, so I have decided that the ultimate goal of my career will be to accelerate the emergence of this industry.

                  I will walk the surface of Mars.
